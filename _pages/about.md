I'm an associate professor at Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU), and is now working as a visiting researcher at Chalmers University of Technology (CTH).
I have been the principle investigator in 4 science projects and have coauthored over 20 papers in journals and international conference proceedings. My research expertise include signal processing, system design, and parameter optimization in massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)  systems and millimeter wave (mmWave) systems.
