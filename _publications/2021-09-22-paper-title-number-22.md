collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-09-22-paper-title-number-22
excerpt: 'In this paper, we study millimeter-wave orthogonal frequency division multiplexing uplink transmission with a wide bandwidth and hybrid receiving. By considering the spatial- and frequency-wideband effects in the channel model, the spectral efficiency of the system is analyzed. The analysis and the
simulation results show the beam squint effect caused by the wideband effects. Moreover, the impacts of the bandwidth and the number of subcarriers on the beam squint effect are revealed.'
