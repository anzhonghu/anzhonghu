excerpt: 'In this paper, we study the optimization of two tilt
angles corresponding to two antenna arrays in each base station
(BS) of a massive multiple-input multiple-output system.  By maximizing
the lower bound or the limit throughput, the two antenna tilt
angles are optimized.'

In this paper, we study the optimization of two tilt
angles corresponding to two antenna arrays in each base station
(BS) of a massive multiple-input multiple-output system.  By maximizing
the lower bound or the limit throughput, the two antenna tilt
angles are optimized.
