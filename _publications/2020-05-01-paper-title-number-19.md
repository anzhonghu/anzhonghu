excerpt: 'This paper investigates pilot design and allocation
in multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with
two-tier receiving.  Based on the analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the discrete Fourier transform
vectors are employed in designing pilots with various correlation
values, and the pilots are allocated to the cells in a greedy
way with the object of maximizing the sum rate upper bound.'
