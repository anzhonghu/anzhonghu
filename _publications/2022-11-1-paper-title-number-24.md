excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate phase noise and channel estimation. Based on angular domain channel sparsity, we employ OMP for channel estimation；Based on the frequency domain phase noise, we reduce the length of phase noise for estimation, and we propose to employ pattern search. We also propose a time variant training method.'

In this paper, we investigate phase noise and channel estimation. Based on angular domain channel sparsity, we employ OMP for channel estimation；Based on the frequency domain phase noise, we reduce the length of phase noise for estimation, and we propose to employ pattern search. We also propose a time variant training method.
