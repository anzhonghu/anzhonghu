title: "Channel estimation via GAMP for millimeter wave
hybrid massive MIMO systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-3-21-paper-title-number-23
excerpt: 'In this paper, we study the channel estimation
problem for the millimeter wave (mm-wave) hybrid massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Based on
the sparsity exhibited by the mm-wave channel in the
angular domain, we select a portion of the beams that
contribute to the communication process from the beam-
space. Then, the  generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is employed to estimate the corresponding channel parameters.'
